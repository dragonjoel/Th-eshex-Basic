# Creating Aspects

Aspects are descriptions of your character and what they do int he greater world around them.

## High Concept

First step is to choose a High Concept for your character. This is the phrase that sums up what your character is. Often will contain either the character ancestry and/or Character classes 

## Trouble

This is the aspect that describes what always gets your character into trouble, is he wanted by the law, does he serve a patron for his magic or is the fact that he’s a kobold always seem to land him in hot water with the locals.

## Another Aspect

This is the last aspect you make for your character alone. This describes something interesting about your character about what he did before the start of the game. This could be his holy quest of that he’s working for a noble house.

## Background Aspects

The last two aspect you create with two other members of your play group. Work with a story that happens before the start of the game with that character to describe and event or quest both the characters experienced together. Once that is done create an aspect around that event. Do that with a second person for your last aspect.

## Name and Description

Now that you have the aspects done this is a good time for you to come up with a name of your character and their description.

## Stress

Your character starts with 3 stress boxes in each stress categories (Physical, Mental, Social)

Physical stress is the representation of how much stress your character can take from physical attacks.

Mental stress represents how strong your characters mental fortitude is. This is used against wizards trying to charm you or cast other spells that attack you mentally.
